With support from CTNext, the City of New London, and some very generous individuals, we opened our first community workshop space at 86 Golden Street in New London CT in June 2016. In 2017 we relocated to State Street where we grew from 30 to 130 active members. Spark was awarded a Frank Loomis Palmer grant which helped hire an Executive Director, and awarded 12 scholarships. The move provided an opportunity to restructure the organization and focus on a member-centered approach to organizing. As part of that effort, Spark formed a Member Advisory Council with 2 seats on the Board of Directors. The Council empowered members to develop education policies and procedures. The Council initiated Spark’s hallmark accomplishments of Classes and Meetups where members teach and share skills within the community and with the general public. Spark Makerspace grew beyond the capacity of the State Street location. To accommodate growth and embrace the momentum, Spark and friends bought a historic 9,400 square foot commercial building on Union Street in New London which it renovated throughout 2021 and is proud to say is now completed and open!

HackerMoms is founded on the idea that mothers need a creative outlet and safe environment of encouragement, stimulation, support and permission to explore new ideas. 

We didn’t need another playgroup. We wanted something that didn’t exist, a kid-friendly hackerspace to explore our creative sides. HackerMoms is like the mythical village that raises the child and the mother together.

Is The Manufactory a makerspace, hackerspace, Techshop or Fablab? 

Spaces like ours are a relatively new phenomenon, so the terminology is not well defined. Generally, hackerspaces are small spaces centered around computers and electronics. Some hackerspaces have other hardware for small making projects but lack the full array of equipment offered by makerspaces like The Manufactory. 

Other terms that are commonly used are Techshop or Fablab. These are both trademarked names use by spaces in other parts of the USA. Fablab is a name used by the Fab Foundation for spaces developed under their model. Techshop was an impressive chain of makerspaces with locations all over the country. The created the concept of the full scale makerspace. Unfortunately Techshop filed bankruptcy in 2018. Many attribute excessive spending as the cause of their demise.

Community 

The collaborative environment at Akron Makerspace includes individuals from all walks of life: middle- and high-school students, engineers, teachers, and doctors. With a wide range of skills and talents, our Makers are able to get tips, advice, and help when needed on a build.

History 

Akron Makerspace was founded to connect Makers, DIYers, and programmers and enable them to share resources and build off of one another’s experience. 

Since its inception, we have grown from a small two-car garage into more than 10,000 square feet in Downtown Akron.

22,Anchorrage Makerspace,N,"The Anchorage Makerspace is a non-profit, cooperative community workshop in Anchorage, Alaska. We offer a social space for makers, inventors, artists, entrepreneurs, learners, and dreamers to pool their skills, knowledge and resources for the good of the community. 

Anchorage’s Makers are an enthusiastic group of hobbyists and professionals that identify with the “maker culture” — a movement which encourages experimentation and invention in The Arts and Sciences. The strength of a group is in its members, so if you like to build things (or take them apart), hack hardware, write software, design electronics, work with wood, metal, fiberglass, or plastic, grow your own food, or just look up at the stars and wonder how it all works… well, you’re in the right place. 

Mission Statement 

Our mission is to create a cooperative community workshop in Anchorage, Alaska. The Makerspace is available and accessible as a community resource, offering a social space for makers, inventors, artists, entrepreneurs, learners, and dreamers to pool their skills, knowledge and resources for the good of the community. 

Our Values 

We’re an inclusive community ‐ We foster a safe, inclusive, respectful, family‐friendly space that engages the diverse community of makers without regard to background, style, or perspective. 

We’re an educational organization ‐ We inspire thirst for learning, discovery and self‐improvement by teaching people how to use tools, explore their environment, and bring creations to life; special priority is given to empowering the next generation of makers through communal development of vision, technical skills, and creative wonder. 

  

We encourage creativity ‐ In order to ensure that creativity and self‐expression thrive, we respect each and every member, value their unique contribution to the space and celebrate our diverse capacities. We welcome any form of creative expression which does not compromise the inclusive, emotionally and physically safe nature of our community. 

We enhance the quality of life in our local community ‐ While many people enjoy spending their leisure time making, fixing or creating things, AMS does more than provide community access to tools, expertise and workspace; we also serve our community by working to provide training, workshops, events and activities for the general public, hosting community groups, and lending our capacities to complementary organizations throughout Alaska. 

We support local innovation ‐ We encourage entrepreneurship by: attracting, developing and supporting a large community of smart, creative and experienced people with many different skills; giving them access to a workspace with sophisticated tools; and connecting these makers with the local business community. 

We’re nonprofit and run by volunteers ‐ The Makerspace is only as good as its members make it. We seek out dedicated members who will devote their time, resources and expertise towards sustainably fulfilling our mission for the good of current and future generations of makers. "

24,Arch Reactor,N,"Arch Reactor was founded in 2009 at a local pizza joint by a group of friends who liked technology, programming, making, and pizza. Our first decision was to create a donation can to save for our first space. That donation can (and the $7 that started in it) took us from the food court, to a borrowed apartment, to our first space at the Lemp Brewery (which we outgrew in 3 months!), to our second space at the Jefferson Underground, and finally to our current location in the former Dixie Cream Donut Flour factory. Now St. Louis' original and largest hackerspace, Arch Reactor's growing membership continues to bring new skills, projects, equipment, and people to one place. 

  

We fall under the umbrella of the hackerspace and maker movements. While some of our members are involved in the information security industry, you won't have any fear of getting your phone or computer hacked by visiting our space. The hacking we do is creative, not destructive. When we refer to hacking, we mean either the re-purposing or modification of a commercial product, DIY hacking together of a project, or just the act of exciting, creative work. 

We are a 501c3 Educational Non-Profit Organization. Our space is a communal workshop for our members to share tools and work on projects. It is also a place to learn new skills, either in one of our classes or from the many experts that make up our membership.

We see an Arkansas where, regardless of demographic identifiers or geographic location, Arkansans are generating and inspiring innovation in cutting-edge technology, business, and creative fields. The Innovation Hub uses tools, skills, and expertise to inspire innovators and entrepreneurs who expand the range of educational and economic opportunities for themselves, for their communities, in our state and throughout the world. 

Why We’re Here 

The challenges of the 21st-century startup economy require us to develop, retain, and attract Arkansas’s greatest asset—talent. That goal demands a collaborative community approach: exposing everyone to creative possibilities and offering them access to information, resources and instruction. It also demands we look for and engage that talent everywhere—not just in Central Little Rock, but all over the Arkansas region. 

At our North Little Rock facility, we have created an open environment full of tools, technology, equipment and support. Through formal and informal programs, we provide makers of all ages, interests and skill levels with opportunities for apprenticeship. Through classes in carpentry, welding, graphic design, laser cutting and more, our visitors gain valuable job training, preparing them to navigate the challenges of the modern workforce. 

Our mobile makerspace, the Innovation Hub on Wheels, takes that learning on the road, tapping the potential of Arkansas’ underserved communities. The result? An acceleration of innovation that spurs employment, job creation, and economic and community growth, lifting up Arkansas and the surrounding region. "

29,AS220 Labs,N,"AS220 is an artist-run organization committed to providing an  unjuried and uncensored forum for the arts. AS220 offers artists  opportunities to live, work, exhibit and/or perform in its facilities,  which include several rotating gallery spaces, a performance stage, a  black-box theater, a print shop, a darkroom and media arts lab, a  fabrication and electronics lab, a dance studio, a youth program  focusing on youth under state care and in the juvenile detention  facilities, four dozen affordable live/work studios for artists, and a  bar and restaurant. AS220’s facilities and services are available to any  artist who needs a place to exhibit, perform, or create original work  and its classes and public-access studios are among the most affordable  in the nation. 

Vision: AS220 envisions a just world where all people can realize their full creative potential. 

Mission: We, the people of Rhode Island, associate ourselves for the purpose of providing a local forum and home for the arts, through the maintenance of residential and work studios, galleries, performance and educational spaces. Exhibitions and performances in the forum will be unjuried, uncensored and open to the general public. Our facilities and services are made available to all artists who need a place to exhibit, perform, or create their original artwork, especially those who cannot obtain space to exhibit or perform from traditional sources because of financial or other limitations. 

Values: A value is a deeply held belief, ideal or principle that inspires action.  

Creative at our core: we believe all people are born creative and that everyone is an artist.  We embrace an expansive view of art and resist narrowly defined, Westernized and commercialized definitions of art and its value in society.  We experiment with new ideas and alternative models that help us adapt to our staff and communities’ evolving needs.  Our own creativity as artists informs all we do at AS220. 

Building community: we believe there is magic and power in bringing people from different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, identities and perspectives together.  We work to build genuine, reciprocal relationships with our artists, audiences, peer organizations and community collaborators, and to honor the connections we make.  We nurture a spirit of volunteerism: we welcome and thank people who use their skills, knowledge, expertise and time to build community with us. 

Freedom of expression: AS220 was founded on the principle that freedom of expression is crucial for the development of strong communities and individual spirits.   We strive to facilitate opportunities for people to discover, explore, and nurture their own creativity and share their unique artistic voice. 

Collective impact: we believe artists play a critical role in shaping our communities and together are a force for change.  We bring our voices together to advocate, inspire, dream, dissent, engage and vision for the future we want to see for ourselves and our communities. 

A just world: AS220 has a vision for a just and equitable world where all people can realize their full creative potential.  We recognize systems of oppression — such as racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism, and economic and environmental injustice — are active in our communities, and we strive to work against their root causes while centering and celebrating the unique perspectives that help shape AS220’s community.  

Racial justice: we believe that racism is the bedrock of our nation.  Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPoC) continue to be adversely impacted by the social systems present in our communities.  AS220 is committed to examining how each dimension of racism shows up within our organization, and to work alongside those most impacted by racism to transform AS220 into an anti-racist space where BIPoC are not only centered in our work, but are shaping where we’re going in the future.  

Facilitating access to artistic opportunities: we believe access to artistic opportunities can transform communities and change lives.  We believe that providing access to knowledge, space, tools and technology supports people to come together, collaborate, experiment and take risks.  We recognize different people need different forms of access to participate: we work to make full participation possible for our artists and audiences.  

Intergenerational, lifelong learning: transformative learning happens when people have a sustained relationship with people and place.  We work to provide opportunities for people to live and grow at AS220, and to bring their families into our spaces.  Together we create an environment where people of all ages can participate, teach and learn from one another.  

Generous and generative: AS220 generates ideas, opportunities, creative expression and community.  We are dedicated to generously sharing our knowledge and expertise with others, supporting them to foster their own ideas, opportunities, nonprofits, creative communities, and more. 

The power of process: as artists, we know the process is as important as the outcome.  We value the learning, collaboration and potential for evolution — both personal and organizational — that exists in the process of doing, and reflecting on, our work.  We seek to create inclusive processes and space, and to work collaboratively with our staff and communities.  We strive to ensure that our values, initiatives, and decisions reflect the will of our communities while recognizing the inevitability of differing perspectives and ideas. 

Transparency: we strive to be open with each other and our communities about how we do our work, and where we need to improve.  We challenge ourselves not to be defensive, and to work towards a culture of openness, honesty, responsiveness and mutual accountability.  We know there is no such thing as perfection: we encourage ourselves and others to learn from mistakes. "

Who are we? 

We are a bunch of people that want to do interesting things and explore the world and technology around us.

What is a hackerspace? 

A hackerspace is a physical location where people can share resources for their own creative pursuits. It's also a resource where people can come in off the street and advance their own knowledge. In urban locations it can often be hard to find places to weld/build/make noise and keep projects on-going without having to tear down and put-up your work each evening. With a hacker space people can work on their projects and not worry about annoying their neighbors or spouses. The social aspect is also an incredibly important component. Having people to bounce ideas off of and discuss your projects with when you get stuck is a great thing. "

Visit us for a free tour whenever we're open—we're just north of Costco on the south side of Ann Arbor. Take safety classes on the tools you need. Start your membership for a day, month, quarter, or year. 

What if there was a place in Washtenaw County where anyone could walk in and learn to use a tool to make the thing they wanted? What would that look like if it had some fancy tools, quality training, and space to work? 

It could be a community that empowers artists like Laura Earle and Gabriel Urist to create socially conscious communities of art. One that helps people like University of Michigan Stamps alumna Erika Cross go from a talented graduate to Best in Show at the NYCxDesign Awards. Or when a pandemic shuts down access to his lab at EMU, Kevin Purify is able to continue his studies. 

Perhaps it could work with kids, providing ‘first swing’ of a hammer opportunities to thousands of kids every year. Introducing “yes-you-can” opportunities of creation through activities like Intro to Household Tools, birdhouse building, and racing small cars down a track.  

They could partner with the local high school FIRST Robotics Teams to provide greater access to tools, technology, and space to build their robots. Some of these teams would make it to the world championships, and many of the students would be hired by local engineering firms. 

It could enable companies like Nostrum and Nimbus to research and prototype in a cost effective environment, with access to a community of talented makers capable of using the latest technology. Or two fresh college grads with an idea, kickstarting their business to success using tools they only could have dreamed of without access to this facility. 

It would only be natural that this place would honor repair and reuse before recycle, and long before ‘replace’. They would run regular events, call them “Fix-It-Friday” that help reduce the waste in the environment and rebuild a community of righty-tighty lefty-loosey tool users. Everything from picture frames, pachinko machines, electric scooters, and broken chairs would be given a second life and kept out of the landfill. 

After some inspiring work with a local Tinker Toy Tech group that runs annual events adapting toys for accessibility, they’d start a recurring monthly Toy Adaptation event where parents and kids could come to freely adapt their toys. 

In their spare time, some members would find themselves building Sensory Chairs, Foster Care Beds, and Braille Calculators for the community.  

While we’re dreaming, it could be a shop that understands both tools and a welcoming culture. It would constantly improve to be more accessible, affordable, and welcoming regardless of age, gender, race, sex, or ability.  

But we’re not dreaming. This is what happens at Maker Works. "

When our environment is combined with a larger perceived shift in our societal relationship with technology, thrift, DIY, repurposing, green tech and community involvement . . . well, that is the making of a movement. In the broadest strokes we see a community hangout and fab shop where projects are likely to be developing at any hour of the day, classes taught to the public encouraging people to break the seal and void the warranty, learn to solder or learn to code, banks of computers doing our bidding and cool tools and toys in every direction; welding, woodshop, servers, switches, coils, machining, molding, pulleys, pendulums, silkscreen . . . steam-punk fire-breathing robots.

Ultimately we seek to further our knowledge as individuals and as a group by learning what we can from each other. 

Our Makerspace Goals 

Everyone has their own goals for the group, but these seem to be the recurring ones: 

Find people who like to create things, share ideas, and collaborate. 

Work on individual and group projects. 

Educate and inform others who would like to know how to do some of these kinds of projects. "
289,Milwaukee Makerspace,N,"Milwaukee Makerspace, at its heart, is a place for people who like to build, invent, tinker and/or learn new skills and expand their minds. We have a wide range of skill sets in our membership and you’re likely to find someone who can talk about most any technical concept with you in a meaningful way. We are a physical space where you can come, 24/7 as a member, and have access to wide array of equipment you are not very likely to have at home. Plus, there are folks around the space that can give you tips and pointers on operating that equipment effectively. We will train you to use the equipment, and ask that you do the same for others. 

We aim to foster a community of makers by providing an environment in terms of people, equipment and space that supports the creative process and personal growth. Modern software, the Internet and economies of scale have all come together to allow ordinary people with a little bit of know-how to begin blurring the lines between manufacturer and consumer. With some effort and the help of a growing community of makers it is possible for a lone individual to make things of amazing quality and functionality. Makerspaces that act as hubs for the maker community are popping up all over the world. We may be on the verge of the ‘Age of the Amateur’, as one blogger put it. 

In our space you’ll find people into electronics, robots, wood working, embedded software, metal working (including welding, forging and casting) music, art, video, pottery, electric cars, sewing, textiles, printing and much more. We’ve found that having such people pursuing their interests in close proximity to one another leads to a lot of productively, personal satisfaction and some amazing collaborative projects. We hope you’ll come be a part it. 

If you think you might like to join the Milwaukee Makerspace, you should come to one of our free and open-to-the public meetings (Some Tuesdays at 7PM). Please check our calendar for locations and details. Check us out. Try us out. Bring a project you could use a little advice on. See if the vibe feels right to you. In the process you’re likely to make a couple of friends who’d be willing to sponsor you as a member. With the sponsorships you can pay your first month’s dues and get access to the space. Why the sponsorship business? We need to make sure that we protect the safe and supportive environment that we’ve cultivated. To that end, we want to make sure that a couple members know you before you join. So, the free and open-to-the-public night not only gives you a chance to get to know us, but also give us a chance to get to know you. "
292,Mobile MakerSpace,N,"Who are we? We’re a group of hobbyists who work with everything from electronics to woodworking, and are interested in everything from cooking to quantum physics. Our members are computer geeks, engineers, artists, students, and everything in between. 

Who are makers? You, me, anyone and everyone. A maker is a person who has a passion for learning, experimentation, tinkering, and teaching. Do you find yourself taking things apart to see how they work? Do you tend to try to fix things instead of buying new? Do you ever spend an afternoon daydreaming about an invention or an idea? If you answer yes to any of these, then you are a maker! 

What do we do? We work on projects at the space. We have monthly meetings to discuss our passion for making. We share project ideas and collaborate together.

309,NoiseBridge,N,"Noisebridge is a fun space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, learning. Noisebridge is a physical space open and welcoming to all, providing infrastructure and collaboration opportunities for anyone interested in programming, hardware, crafts, science, robotics, art, and technology. We teach, we learn, we share. With no leaders, we have one rule: ""Be excellent to each other"". 

Noisebridge is a creative technology community for excellent, do-ocratic, consensus-based collaboration.  

Excellence: Be excellent to each other is the guiding principle of Noisebridge. Wikipedia uses a somewhat similar rule, which they call ""the fundamental rule of all social spaces. Every other policy for getting along is a special case of it."" Unlike Wikipedia, Noisebridge takes a positive approach, and avoids the practice of officially enumerating the myriad potential special cases; ""be excellent"" is enough. 

Do-ocracy: Doing excellent stuff at Noisebridge does not require permission or an official consensus decision. If you're uncertain about the excellence of something you want to do, you should ask someone else what they think. 

Consensus: We make official Noisebridge decisions by consensus, which means the willing consent of all of our members. Decisions are typically made at our weekly meetings or via our online management venues, and items proposed for consensus are announced at least a week in advance to give everyone time to hear about them. Conceivably, members could block by proxy if they are unable to attend or if they wish to block anonymously. 

Noisebridge is an educational non-profit corporation, 501(c)3 public charity status. 

We provide infrastructure and collaboration opportunities for people interested in programming, hardware hacking, physics, chemistry, mathematics, security, robotics, all kinds of art, and, of course, technology. Through talks, workshops, and projects we encourage knowledge exchange, learning, and mentoring. 

As a space for artistic collaboration and experimentation, we are open to most types of art - with a special emphasis on the crossover of art and technology. From hardware labs to electronics and sound labs, most things that're creative are most definitely welcome. 

Many interesting things happen in the space. We've found that sharing is essential to making this work. We strive to begin from a point of respect and trust. We believe it builds a safe community and that this best fosters innovation and creation. Our motto is ""Be excellent to each other."" We also have writings on community standards and an anti-harassment policy which covers all conduct in the physical space and in our online spaces.  

Leadership is taken by individual members for specific projects. We call this ""sudo leadership"" after the *nix command sudo which allows a regular user to do one root-level, or superuser, task. In other words, if you want Noisebridge to do something, start doing it. 

Here's some paraphrasing from our bylaws: Through talks, classes, workshops, collaborative projects, and other activities, we want to encourage research, knowledge exchange, learning, and mentoring in a safe, clean space. We provide educational spaces for teaching practical skills and theory of technology, science, and art. We provide work space, storage, and other resources for projects related to art, science, and technology that will benefit the individual members' personal growth in their fields of interest, encouraging the individual members to share their projects and knowledge for the betterment of society through art, science and technology. We create, learn, and teach, individually and as a group, inviting members of the community in the San Francisco Bay area and the world. We develop, support the development of, and provide resources for the development of free and open source software and hardware for the benefit of society. We promote collaboration across disciplines for the benefit of cultural, charitable, and scientific causes. "

It took over a year of planning, clean-out, and construction to make the MakerBarn a reality. “If you build it, they will come.” In June 2016, The MakerBarn opened, people came, they saw the value, and membership started to grow.

We are located at 7608 N Interstate Avenue in Portland, Oregon and serve as a local community hub as well as a thriving online community with roots extending around the world. 

Our organization provides two unique, very deep universal needs. Two needs that have been way too scarce for way too long. Community and Creative Expression. We evolved as a species on the planet to survive in a sometimes hostile environment, and have done so by supporting each other in community. We need community. One of the things we did in community was get together to make and share useful tools. And just because we, as a species, might be able to now buy the things we need doesn’t mean we don’t also need to create. We have a deep inner drive to create. It’s who we are. 

WHAT WE DO 

The essence of hacking is to take something, improve it, then share it with the rest of the world. Our Hackerspace fosters supportive community where individuals teach because they love teaching and learn because they love learning; All geared towards enabling individuals to live the lives they want to live. 

We exist for a couple really important reasons. One is that real education happens at Hackerspaces. As education bureaucracies around the world continue to sometimes fail us, Hackerspaces will continue to fill in more of the void, where people teach because they love teaching and where people learn because they love learning. And secondly, local economies grow at Hackerspaces. Hackerspaces provide supportive community for exploring and doing what you love. And if you do what you love, chances are really good other people are going to love it too, and in a capitalist society, if people love what you do, people will pay you to do it. Many companies have grown this way, so if your company grows and you need help, you can hire from the local community! This creates local economy that works for everyone. The future of economies everywhere is creative and Hackerspaces are a fantastic place to explore your creativity. "

A place where people with an interest in arts, manufacturing, computing and technology can gather to work on projects while sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge 

Pumping Station: One is a community of hackers and makers that work together to become greater than the sum of their parts. 

We have 2 primary rules: Be excellent to each other, and JFDI, Just Fucking Do It. In a community of over 300 members where we are run entirely on other hackers choosing to sacrifice time and energy on the continued growth and awesomeness of the organization, we occasionally have to clarify what it means to be excellent through policies that are democratically voted on by the Full Membership. Once being excellent has been satisfied: JFDI remains. There is no need to ask permission to hack the space or change it some way, within reason. 

Member Driven 

Pumping Station: One has no employees, only members. 

The majority of our large equipment is purchased via votes proposed by members who hold no title or position at PS:One. The money for these purchases comes exclusively from membership dues. Our organization is fully self supporting. Policies, and member agreements on what Be excellent to each other means are voted on by the membership. There is a Board of Directors. Most of the Board's decision making power is not special, it is member decision making power being applied. Members become board members because they get things done in the organization, and not the other way around. We actively encourage all members to tackle problems - very few issues can be dealt with exclusively by members of the board. 

Volunteer Driven 

Pumping Station: One has no employees. No one has any obligations other than Be excellent to each other. Those who do things, do things because they want to, and are free to stop or change doing the things at any time. This does mean that some tasks fall by the wayside. It also means that any member is free to pick them up and carry them out. We actively encourage people to stop volunteering once it is not longer fun or fulfilling. This is to prevent burnout. Excellent people have a tendency to stay excellent if given the freedom to choose his or her area of excellence. "

394,SYN Shop,N,"SYN Shop is a hackerspace serving the Las Vegas Valley in Nevada. It is a space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, learning. Our motto is: “Let’s make stuff awesome!” 

SYN Shop was started back in 2008, when a bunch of DIY enthusiasts decided that instead of hiding in our garages, workshops and offices, we should instead come together and start a community around the things we are passionate about. 

Who We Are 

We are hackers, makers, artists, innovators, inventors, people of knowledge, and people who want to learn. We are people who take things apart to see how they work. We design the new because it has not been done before, and we reinvent what has already been done for the challenge of doing it ourselves. We’re here to discover the unknown, to teach others, and to put our mark on the world by helping others. We’re here to form a community of people who come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things. 

The Name 

What does the name “SYN Shop” mean, and why do we call ourselves by that name? When computers need to talk to one another over the network, SYN is the first packet sent out during the TCP three-way handshake. Since Hacker Spaces are about communication, we felt this was a good way of symbolizing what we do. You can also say that Syn, could stand for “Synergy”. Synergy is defined as two or more things functioning together to produce a result not independently obtainable, which also fits well with the Hacker Space ideals. And lastly since we live in Las Vegas, SYN is a fun play on words with the city’s often heard nickname “Sin City.” "

""A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate."" 

Here at Xerocraft, we expand this to include interests that encompass a wide variety of hobbies and arts, as well as technology and the sciences; often in conjunction. 

What we do 

We collaborate, hypothesize, learn, teach, create, and socialize. We attempt to hold frequent workshops teaching anything from basic Arduino programming, to how to extract DNA, to how to use a welder or 3D-printer, to how to build a coffee table. We are always open to suggestions for workshops, and don't mind helping total strangers with answering questions, or showing how to use an unfamiliar piece of equipment.

MakerspaceCT is a skills development center for makers, manufacturers, entrepreneurs, members and students. Since 2019, we have offered our community unparalleled support and resources to learn and create. The 28,000 square foot workshop in the iconic G. Fox Building in downtown Hartford is a place for residents, students, hobbyists, aspiring innovators, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs to access the tools, technology, resources and educational opportunities they need to succeed in the state’s manufacturing and technology workforce.  

The ten individual workshops we provide are equipped with cutting-edge hardware and software, offering virtual reality equipment and programming to support education-to-career pathways. Our professional and instructional staff are versed in digital fabrication and design processes, making us uniquely suited to provide innovative, outcomes-based programs. We have meaningful collaborations with schools and universities in the STEM disciplines and connect program graduates with local manufacturers. 

MakerspaceCT is committed to providing accessible programming that reflects the community and times in which we operate. As the effects of the coronavirus pandemic continue to devastate America’s health, economy, and workforce, a comprehensive recovery will be slower for marginalized students who are less likely to receive the tailored education and training required to secure and sustain successful careers in the technology and manufacturing sectors. The remedy lies in our work on-the-ground to address the systemic gaps through a content rich, curriculum-based instruction that fosters academic mastery across a range of technology and manufacturing subjects, with cross-cutting skills, critical thinking, and collaboration.

(LSI) is to support innovative economic development in post-industrial, semi-rural communities by providing opportunities to explore and develop hands-on skills in support of enhanced personal satisfaction, increased employment value, and business incubation to benefit individuals, schools, businesses and the broader community.  

Vision Statement 

LaunchSpace, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation committed to innovative economic development in post-industrial, semi-rural communities, has created a makerspace in Orange, Massachusetts to serve the North Quabbin and surrounding community by providing space and equipment for: 

Creation - by providing workshop space and equipment for local craftspeople to produce their work, collaborate with other makers, and take classes that teach members and non-members maker-based skills. 

Education - by operating a training center that serves as a satellite campus for community colleges to provide workforce development opportunities, offer job training certificates, “micro” credit courses, and access to higher education and online learning; and to serve as an extension of partnering organizations for educational events. 

Incubation - by providing physical space and other supportive resources for entrepreneurs launching businesses with a focus on the creative economy or the value-added food economy. 

In more detail, these three tiers are: 

A member-based, multi-skill, collaborative and diverse shop environment providing tools, equipment, education and support to people who want to create and learn skills but don’t have the desire, space or means to build a shop of their own; 

Instruction, both practical and theoretical, for development of a skilled workforce for both increased employment value for individuals, and as a critical part of attracting new employers to the region as well as improving the capabilities of existing employers; and, 

A business incubator supporting development of the value-added food and creative economy, specifically, for those who would like to start an arts and/or making-based business but who don’t have the capital to invest in a fully equipped shop and storage facility. 

This creative and collaborative ecosystem for innovation serves different community stakeholders: makers, artists, unemployed, small businesses, entrepreneurs, remote workers, and other independent professionals. The curated environment of creativity and self-starter energy gives rise to organic networking for entrepreneurs to share ideas and collaborate. More tangibly, the space provides access to resources such as super fast high-speed internet not readily available in this rural area but sorely needed to develop business—especially those in the high-tech industries.

512,Kzoo Makers,N,"Kzoo Makers is a volunteer operated 501(c)(3) public charity: charitable contributions include community development, economic development, and education-supporting resources for Kalamazoo and surrounding communities. 

Our Mission: 

To offer a collaborative workspace with equipment and programs. 

Hands-on environment for creativity, exploration, and building new skills. 

A place our community can turn their ideas into creations by fostering a culture of local innovation. 

An opportunity to innovate 

Makerspaces foster innovation through hands-on experimentation. Participants have the opportunity to be creative and apply personalized learning strategies to make changes to existing concepts or develop their own ideas, methods or products. 

Hands-on learning 

You can learn concepts through books, lectures, and videos, but in a makerspace you have an opportunity to take an abstract concept and put it into practice. 

Makerspaces help businesses flourish 

We can be a major support system for experienced creators trying to turn their hobbies into businesses. Steve De La Cruz, business development and operations manager at MakePlus in Los Angeles, also runs his woodworking design store, Main & 38th, almost entirely out of the makerspace. For Steve, joining MakePlus cut the entry barrier for his business, saving him tens of thousands of dollars in startup costs like tools, insurance, and utilities. 

Developing a wide range skills 

Learning new skills go beyond studying and problem solving. These important skills include flexibility, collaboration, adaptability, oral and written communication, information literacy, technology literacy, productivity, social skills, leadership, initiative and more. "

517,The Foundry,N,"Our Mission 

The Foundry was established as a place to allow people to come and realize their creative and making dreams, in a supportive, safe, and inclusive environment. 

Members have use of a spectacular 10,000 sq. ft. shop, professional level tools, and access to professional expertise. Members may also also try new things out, learn new skills, experiment, collaborate, invent, or continue a lifelong practice. The widely varied community of makers result in a space that bring multitudes of different lived experiences and skills together. 

The Foundry is also committed to helping our communities grow stronger and connect with educational, technological, and economic opportunities that our activities support. Young and old have used the Foundry to learn new skills and expand horizons. Local entrepreneurs have utilized the Foundry as a skill builder, idea incubator, and small business accelerator. Artists use the Foundry to make innovative art. The Foundry supports local businesses, entrepreneurs, the creative sector and individuals by offering access to facilities and capabilities that might otherwise be out of reach. 

  

Unique is its approach, the Foundry offers an atmosphere of imaginative invention and creativity, combined with ample making expertise and problem solving savvy. The result is a growing, dynamic resource building stronger connections and communities. 

Our goals are to: 

Nurture and support local businesses, entrepreneurs, the creative sector and individuals in the Northeast Kingdom by providing access to tools, skills and knowledge. 

Work with schools to attract youth to the fields of science, technology, engineering, art, and math, using a hands-on approach. 

Build a community where the arts and the sciences can work together and freely share ideas. 

Have a long-term positive social and economic impact on the Northeast Kingdom. 

In addition to welcoming makers of all stripes, the Foundry offers professional expertise in manufacturing, machining, engineering, inventing, and programming, gained from decades of professional experience. 

Many of our staff members have been instructors and teachers in industrial settings, high schools and colleges. Technical training based on this expertise are critical requirements for a workforce needed to grow Vermont’s economy (citation). The Foundry hopes to increase outreach to younger Vermonters through new S.T.E.A.M.(citation) programs and to work with local industry to provide much needed advanced job training programs. 

How the Foundry works: 

Today, information technology has placed the knowledge of centuries in the hands of billions of people, regardless of location or status. The resulting advent of manufacturing technology has placed the elements of advanced creation within the reach of people of any color or gender. 

We seek to further this spread of knowledge and personal empowerment in a hands-on way, through novel applications of technology, collaboration, pooled talents, and resources. 

By investing people with the inspiration, skill set, and resources to create their own goods, we realize several benefits: 

With hands-on knowledge and experience, the systems and products we use become less magical, and therefore, less confounding. 

As we gain a deeper understanding of the human-made world around us, we become less like a chip afloat on an incomprehensible sea of technology. We instead become pilots; we become active participants. 

We come to appreciate the human-made world around us; things we may have taken for granted now reveal thought and purpose. 

The things we make reflect our individual personalities and have special meaning. We share a connection with them and share them in a different way than we would store-bought things. 

Things we make or repair meet the individual needs of a person, rather than the needs of mass markets. 

What the Foundry does: 

Making, in a community model, offers more than one type of freedom. Prototyped ideas, art works, and new products may be crafted to fit niche or mass markets. Almost anything can be made on collectively owned machinery that would be far beyond the budget of the average person.  

Collaborators at the Foundry form social friendships that are not antagonistically competitive. This is quite a thing to get used to, for many of us who come from industrial production cultures. We learn that workshop failures are not a reflection of our value as human beings. Rather, they are opportunities for humor and learning. Thus, we get along. 

For example, consider a woodworker who learns coding from a compatriot. Now a woodworker sees CNC routing to make guitars, and the coder learns how to use a handheld plane, or the right type of glue to apply. 

We propose to offer workspace to the space deprived. We offer a range of tools, machinery, and expertise beyond the reach of many individual hobbyists or start-ups. We propose to meld numerous thoughts and disciplines- from high-tech to low-tech – into alloyed creation. 

We offer our young people the chance to constructively expand themselves in a collaborative environment. We offer the old tinkerer a shot at new techniques. We offer an exchange between the two.  

We aim to help foster a culture of continuous innovation, and, as a larger community, reap the benefits. 

In conclusion, what we intend is to enable the best of primal human instinct: We are tool-using, social animals. Our very souls feel better when we’ve tools in our hands, possibility before us, and friends at our side. "
518,Cruces Creatives,N,"A makerspace is like a gym or rec center, but for tools, training in how to use them, and connections to a supportive network of creative people. You can learn new skills by participating in classes and workshops; become a member (through volunteering or paying a monthly amount) and get ongoing access to a 12,000 square foot makerspace filled with empowering tools; and, if you'd like, volunteer in one of the many charitable projects launched through the makerspace.  

Cruces Creatives is a non-profit makerspace committed to fostering economic development, furthering education, supporting the arts, protecting the environment, strengthening social connections, and advancing science and technology throughout New Mexico by connecting people with the tools, training, and community to make practically anything. 

Cruces Creatives also works to expand the charitable potential of community makerspaces by adding three core goals to the basic makerspace approach of sharing tools, training, and community: 

Celebrating and supporting all forms of human creativity, using the broadest possible definition of “making.” Cruces Creatives supports woodworkers and engineers; it also supports dance troupes and creative writers. To make is human, and the types of making are wonderfully diverse. 

Maximizing accessibility. Through volunteering, grant support, and the use of donated or recycled materials, most Cruces Creatives classes and workshops are free. People can become members of Cruces Creatives (gaining ongoing access to the space, community, and tools) by contributing either talents (through 3 hours of volunteering weekly in a task of their choosing) or financial support (between $9 and $35 per person, per month). 

Using the tools, people, and infrastructure brought together through the makerspace to launch interdisciplinary charitable projects, responding to needs in our city and state. 

At Cruces Creatives, we have three main goals: 

1.    Safety 

2.    Creativity 

3.    Community 

Our policies reflect these goals to make Cruces Creatives safe, productive, and welcoming. "

520,Makerspace Greenville,N,"Makerspaces, FabLabs, Hackerspaces and your shed out back have several things in common. Mostly they are places for you to go to make something.

Well that’s where these other places have one up on your shop at home. 

Makerspaces are generally a place where you’ll find lots of tools. Probably some you have. More than likely some you don’t have, or even some you never thought you could afford. Sure some of them are big and scary, but that’s where we come in. Come use our tools here. 

We here at makerspace want to help you make your thing. If that’s a part off your old bicycle that no one manufactures anymore, or a dining room table you want to pass down to your grandkids.

524,Newton Makers,N,"Make Things 

Makers make things by hand because they are compelled to do so. The funny thing about making things by hand is that you can’t really explain to someone else why it’s so satisfying. You have to actually do it to know it. So consider yourself invited to find out for yourself.
